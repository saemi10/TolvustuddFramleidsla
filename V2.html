							<h2>Computer aided cutting</h2>
							<p>Project 2 in Computer aided fabrication - Work in Progress</p>
						</header>

								<h2>Intro</h2>
								<p>Project 2 was made up of two parts. <br /> <b>Part 1:</b><br /> Cutting with a programmable vinyl cutter. Available materials were 1000x500 mm sheet of vinyl.<br /> <b>Part 2:</b><br /> Designing parametric pressfit model from more then one building blocks and cutting it out with a laser cutter. Available materials were 4x500x500 mm birch plywood or 3x500x500 mm acrylic plastic (plexiglass). Excess cardboard paper from the FabLab and materials we brought ourselves were also allowed.</p>

								<h2>Part 1 - Vinyl</h2>
								<h3>Thought process and preperation</h3>
								<p>I started by creating a table in an Excel spreadsheet to ceep track of my worktime and to categorize it. Then I browsed YouTube for ideas for the vinyl cutter. Or that was the purpose at least. I used the search words "vinyl cutter" and found <a href="https://youtu.be/5Yo3plor5uE">this video</a> about how to operate a vinyl cutter. I found the video informing but not very inspirational. That was okay though because I had an idea. I could use the vinyl cutter to make logo stickers for my newfounded company Zerobars ehf (website will be linked when it's ready).</p>
								<p>Next step was to download Inkscape and to get to know it a bit. I tried some buttons, read some descriptions, drew some shapes and even tried to import .jpg files. When that was done I decided that the preperation was over and I sould move to designing the stickers.</p>
								<p>Total worktime: 2 hours.</p>
								<h3>Creating cutting path</h3>
								<p>I descided to use this project to create stickers of the logo of my startup company: Zerobars. I started by opening Inkscape and importing a .jpg file of the logo. Then I opened "Document properties" and changed the page size to 1000 x 500 mm. I copy-pasted the logo many times over, resized some of them and draged around until I had reached an adequate usage of the page. The next step was to trace the bitmap of every single image. I played with the "Brightness threshold" and tried values from 0,250 to 0,990. I think the 0,990 value will be better in the end, but we will see when I run it through the cutter. I also experimented with inverting the image. I don't know wheter that will work or not, but it is worth the try.</p>

								<h2>Part 2 - Pressfit</h2>
								<h3>Thought process and preperation</h3>
								<p>I started by browsing Pinterest for ideas for wooden pressfit projects. I used the search words "press fit plywood project". I found some amazing work and that was really inspirational. The links are below.<br /><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/216172850838374677/">Pinterest 1</a><br /><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/358458451565001587/">Pinterest 2</a><br /><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/420945896394845671/">Pinterest 3</a><br /><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/420945896394845694/">Pinterest 4</a><br /><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/420945896394845663/">Pinterest 5</a> </p>
								<p>I am used to using Autodesk Inventor and I am currently in a course about drawing in DS Solidworks but for the sake of spending more time on the project it self, rather than getting stuck on problems due to the difference between Fusion 360 and those programs, I decided to install Fusion 360 on my laptop. Getting the license was really easy because I already had an Autodesk student account. But the downloading and installation still took a long time and I really wanted to make sure that I did not make any mistakes in the installation proccess.</p>
								<p>When Fusion 360 was finished installing I opened tutorials fram <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGVeAIo0roKGs_tf3t4VCiA">Jón Þór</a> regarding parametric design and getting a 3D object on to a laser cuttable 2D format. I followed through the tutorials and made sure to repeat every step myself and that made me understand those actions a lot better.</p>
								<p>Total worktime: 5 hours.</p>

								<h3>Measuring Kerf</h3>
								<p>When using a laser cutter, you have to account for the kerf of the laser, that is the thickness of the cut itself. To measure the kerf, I teamed up with <a href="https://frikki2801.github.io/TolvustuddFramleidsla/">Friðrik Valur</a> and <a href="https://finnurme.github.io/Heimasi-a/">Finnur Mauritz</a>.</p>
								<p>We started by creating a simple drawing of a few rectangles in Fusion 360. Each rectangle was 10x10 mm and the number of rectangles was 9. The reason for that choice was that with 9 rectangles, you have 10 paralell cuts of equal size. That meant that we could make the cut in the laser cutter, push all the rectangles to one side, measure the gap and devide by 10.</p>

										<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Measure_kerf_fusion_parameters.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>
								</div>
								<p>Next step was to export the Fusion file to .dxf format and open it with Inkscape. In Inkscape we found out that we made a mistake in the Fusion drawing. When we drew in Fusion, we drew one rectangle and used linear pattern to make the rest of them, that is we duplicated the first one 9 times automaticly. We should have only duplicated 3 sides of the original rectangle but we selected all of them. As a result we had two lines where there sould only have been one for all the vertical ones except for the ends. But by selecting the duplicated lines in Inkscape and deleting them one by one, we fixed the problem.</p>
								<p>Then we selected all the lines in the drawing and adjusted 3 parameters. We set the fill to none, the stroke paint to flat color and the stroke style thickness to 0,020mm. We exported the file once again but this time as a .svg file and we saved it to a USB flash drive.</p>

									</div>
								</div>
								<p>The laser cutter in the FabLab in VR-III was connected to a PC that had the nessecary software already on it to run the laser cutter based on our .svg file. We plugged the USB stick into the PC and opened the file with Inkscape. We doublethecked if all parameters were the same as before and pressed CTRL+P, then ENTER on the keyboard. That took us to the program controlling the laser cutter.</p>
								<p>On that stage of our project, we were not shore whether we whanted to use acrylic plastic or plywood so we decided to measure the kerf in both materials. We adjusted the program for plywood and placed a sheet of 4mm thick plywood on in the laser cutter. We positioned the drawing on the plate in the software using a camera feed from the cutter.</p>
								<p>The settings in the laser cutter control program were:</p>

								<p>The last step was to measure the gap with a calliper and divide by 10. Our results were that for the plywood, the kerf of the laser cutter is 0.167 mm and for the acrylic plastic, it is 0.133 mm.</p>
